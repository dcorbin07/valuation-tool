# HANDOFF — executing the external edge audit (`VALQUO_EDGE_AUDIT.md`)

Session opened 2026-08-03. Source: the 108-item external catalogue produced by a read-only Cowork
session at commit `7eb0046`. Every finding in it is a **code-reading** finding — nothing was executed —
so each item arrives as a hypothesis with a file:line citation, and the first job on every one is to
check it against the code rather than believe it or defend the record.

Item IDs are the audit's own (`B*`, `R*`, `X*`, `S*`, `O*`, `U*`, `C*`, `P*`, `D*`, `M*`) and are cited
in every commit message so the ledger stays traceable.

# PART 0 — THE PRE-COMMITMENTS

**Written 2026-08-03, before a single result was read. Not to be revised afterwards.**

The failure mode of handing an audit to the audited is motivated reading. These are recorded first
so that a later number cannot quietly select its own threshold.

## R1 — factor-adjusted alpha, and the product claim that follows

The test: regress the 63-day top-decile-minus-equal-weight series on FF5+MOM (Ken French, free), and
separately on the Hou–Xue–Zhang q-factors. Report the intercept, its Newey–West *t*, R², and every
loading. Repeat on the long-short series.

**Committed threshold.** The word *alpha* stays in product copy **only if the FF5+MOM intercept is
positive with Newey–West t > 2.0.** Not 1.9. Not "t > 2 on one of the two models" — FF5+MOM is the
deciding model; the q-factor result is reported alongside as the harder test and is informative, not
deciding.

**Both product claims are written now, before the number exists:**

- *If the intercept clears t > 2.0:* "Valquo's top decile has produced excess return that is not
  explained by the standard equity factors — a Fama–French 5-factor plus momentum regression leaves a
  positive intercept of X%/yr, t = Y. Here is the regression, the loadings, and the live forward track."
- *If it does not:* "Valquo delivers diversified, transparent factor exposure — value, quality,
  momentum, size, capital discipline and institutional ownership — assembled point-in-time, screened
  for cost and tax, with the holdings and the live track published. It is not a claim of secret alpha;
  a Fama–French regression attributes X% of the excess return to known factor premia. What you are
  buying is construction, freshness and honesty about which is which."

The second claim ships without argument if the number says so. Whichever the regression supports is
the one that goes on the site.

**Corollary committed now:** if the intercept is indistinguishable from zero, further *signal hunting*
on the equity side is close to worthless, and the remaining edge is construction, cost, tax and
capacity (audit Part VI / P1). The roadmap changes accordingly, in the same pass.

## R2 — the corrected options re-run

After the **B1** price-basis fix, re-run the 187-name book, both random-entry control seeds, the
`term_slope` out-of-sample test and the broad autopsy.

**Committed threshold, before the run.** The current headline negative — random entry (+13.22%) beats
the signal (+5.14%), a −8.08pp gap, sign-test z = −5.24 — is being re-derived on corrected data. It
will be tempting to read the re-run charitably.

- If the corrected real-versus-control gap **remains negative at conventional significance under a
  date-block bootstrap (R3)**: the entry signal is dead, and the record says so plainly.
- If the gap **closes to within its confidence interval**: the verdict is **INCONCLUSIVE**, not
  vindicated. A signal that cannot beat random entry by a measurable margin is not a signal; it is an
  alert-generation mechanism, and the product copy has to say so.
- If the gap **turns positive at significance**: that is a genuine reversal, and it must additionally
  survive the date-block bootstrap and the both-halves split before anything is claimed from it.

The paired name-year sign test and paired *t* must be **in the repository with a test** before this
verdict is reported at all (R3.3) — the two numbers the whole options conclusion currently rests on
are not reproducible from shipped code.

## R7 — the `term_slope` retention floor, argued and committed before re-scoring

Not a renegotiation of a failed bar to make it pass. The re-commitment below **adds an arm that has
never been measured**, and `term_slope` can still fail on it.

**What the 40% floor actually was.** `options_autopsy.py:36` states G3's purpose: "A filter that keeps
8% of alerts has not improved the strategy, it has replaced it with a smaller one." That is a
*product* rationale, not a statistical one — the statistical risk is already carried by G4
(`n_kept >= MIN_TRADES`) and by G6 (beats a random filter keeping the same count). The 40% figure was
never derived; it is a round number, and the 55-name run cleared it by 0.6pp.

**Why a raw percentage is the wrong unit on a larger universe.** A fixed-threshold filter applied to a
broader book is mechanically more selective — more names means more of the distribution's left side —
so a constant percentage floor makes any filter fail as the universe grows, which is a scale artefact
and not a statement about filter quality. The percentage is a proxy for two distinct things: *is there
still enough alert flow to trade*, and *is what survives concentrated into a handful of names or dates*.
Measure those two directly.

**Committed floor for a 187-name (or larger) universe, replacing the single 40% arm:**

1. **G3a — flow.** The filtered book must leave **≥ 52 tradeable alerts per year** on the deployed
   universe. One per week is the minimum cadence at which a user can build and roll a diversified
   book; below it the filter has produced a different product regardless of its expectancy.
2. **G3b — concentration (NEW, never measured).** The retained trades must span **≥ 60% of the names**
   and **≥ 60% of the calendar months** that the unfiltered book spans. This is the real failure mode
   the percentage was proxying for, and it is measured directly here for the first time.
3. **G3c — backstop.** Retention **≥ 20%** of alerts. Stated plainly as a judgement, not a derivation:
   below one-in-five, four of every five alerts are discarded and the filter is manifestly the
   strategy rather than a refinement of it.

All three must pass, in both split directions, alongside the unchanged G1, G2, G4, G5, G6, G7. The
previously-reported 36.4% clears G3c; whether it clears G3b is unknown as of this writing, and G3b is
the arm on which the re-score can still fail.

## Standing rules for everything in this ledger

- **Ambiguous against its own committed threshold = NULL**, not a judgement call.
- **Full universe only.** ~2,710-name equity panel, full mined options universe. Anything smaller is a
  smoke test and is labelled as one in the same sentence as its number.
- **One change per run** for every A/B panel comparison.
- **A clean rejection is the deliverable.** The project's hit rate is about one adoption in eight.
- Per audit item **B12**, every inherited "800 largest names" figure is an *alphabetical* slice and is
  not citable until re-run on the full universe.
